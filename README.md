# DB-Capstone-Project README

Welcome to the repository for my capstone project, part of Meta's Database Engineering Course. This document details the tasks I have accomplished and explains how the included files align with the project requirements.

## Project Overview

The project tasks include:

### Entity-Relationship Diagram

1. **ER Diagram Creation**
   - Developed an ER Diagram to visually represent and describe the tables, their relationships, and how they map to the required values.

### Database Implementation

2. **MySQL Implementation**
   - Translated the ER Diagram into actual MySQL tables using MySQL Workbench, focusing on accurate syntax, logical structure, and proper relationships among tables.

### Version Control

3. **Version Control Setup**
   - Established a version control system with GIT/GitHub for all project documentation, ensuring correct setup on both GitHub and the local machine. Confirmed that push/pull operations were functioning as intended.

### Advanced SQL Features

4. **SQL Features Implementation**
   - Created virtual tables, joins, procedures, and stored statements in MySQL Workbench and utilized git for SQL code versioning.

### Table Booking System

5. **Table Booking System Development**
   - Designed a system for managing `little_lemon` customer bookings. This includes features for creating, updating, deleting, and querying booking data according to management needs.

### Data Visualization with Tableau

6. **Tableau Integration**
   - Employed Tableau for data filtering and visualization tasks for `little_lemon`'s data.

7. **Data Source Connection**
   - Connected an Excel file as a data source to Tableau.

8. **Data Preparation**
   - Applied filters, cleaned up data, and generated calculated fields to prime the data for analysis and visualization.

9. **Visualization Creation**
   - Crafted various charts and graphs in Tableau to visualize specific datasets utilizing advanced filtering techniques.

10. **Interactive Dashboard**
    - Developed an interactive dashboard in Tableau to enable dynamic data exploration based on specific criteria.

### Python and MySQL Setup

11. **Environment Setup**
    - Configured Python and MySQL environments with Jupyter as the chosen IDE. Set up the database client and confirmed connectivity through cursor-based table queries.

### Code Versioning

12. **Code Backup**
    - Used GIT to version control and back up all the code written for the project.
